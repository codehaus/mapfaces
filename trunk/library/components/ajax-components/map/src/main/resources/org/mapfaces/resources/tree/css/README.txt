Explanation on what is the difference between the 4 css in this folder:


#####################################
drandropW3C.css

This CSS is apply only when Drag'n Drop is activated.


#####################################
tree.css

This is the original css file, it's a copy from ExtJS library, we don't use it but it's a save for developers.

#####################################
treeW3Cn2.css

This file is W3C CSS 2 compliant.
This one is  used by default because CSS 2 is supported by all major browser.

######################################
treeW3Cn3.css

This file is W3C CSS 3 compliant.
All browser doesn't use CSS 3, so it's a css for the future but actually we don't use it.
